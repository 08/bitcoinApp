bugs
* Assertion failed: (_Unwind_SjLj_Resume() can't return), function _Unwind_SjLj_Resume, file /SourceCache/libunwind/libunwind-24.1/src/Unwind-sjlj.c, line 326.
* Only glitch I had: when I launched the app for the 1st time, I noticed that on the Balance tab the block count seemed to get stuck at 1500. I let it sit for a minute or two and nothing happened. Once I quit the app and re-ran it, I saw the network activity icon appear in the top bar and block count started incrementing as blocks were processed. Then it stopped again at 3625. I rolled up to force an "update" and network activity resumed but not the block count.
