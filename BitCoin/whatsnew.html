<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
    <li>No warning if a small fee (0.01BC) is added to some (complex) transactions</li>
    <li>Local node takes a long time to start (up to few minutes) so be patient</li>
    <li>If you stop the local node (Console/stop) you can't restart it. The only way to restart, is to completely exit the App (also from the background) and then start it again. Note that it will automatically restart in this case, so if you want to stop it again you will have to repeat the Console/stop command</li>
    <li>Local node does not accept incoming connections (-nolisten). Also you cant connect to it using HTTP-JSON-RPC from a different machine.</li>
    <li>Backup with email does not work when connected to a remote node</li>
</ul>
