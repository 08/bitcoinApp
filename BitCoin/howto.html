This is an experimental software; you can lose bitcoins as a result. By using this App you agree to its license.
</p>
<p>
This App allows you to use virtual currency in <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">BitCoin peer-to-peer network</a>.
In the network all nodes (your device included) have similar functionality. You can check how many other nodes you are connected to in the Console/getinfo page. It takes some time for the App to find its neighbors so be patient.
</p>
<p>
In the Console/getinfo page you will also notice the amount of blocks currently downloaded by the App. Blocks contain information on all transactions ever made so the amount is substantial (around 118,000 at the time of writing this or 200MB.) The App should download all past blocks before you can start receiving new blocks, that may contain bitcoins directed to you. This can take several hours, but its done only once and you can stop and continue later. There is some delay even after downloading all past blocks, as new blocks are generated about every 10min.
</p>
<p>
    In transactions, bitcoins (and cents of) are carried from one address to another. Your address is given in the My Address page and you can copy-past it to an email or a web site. You can send bitcoins only after you have enough bit coins shown in the Balance page. You can get a tiny amount from the <a href="http://freebitcoins.appspot.com/">Bitcoin Faucet</a> or you can buy coins in one of the exchanges; another option is to mine for bitcoings on your desktop.
</p>
<p>
When sending, enter the address to which you want to send and the amount.
</p>
<p>
Your app contains your own private wallet. As with physical money, if anything happens to your wallet (hardware, software or accident), the entire amount stored in it (as given in the Balance page) will be lost. So be careful. One option is to install and run bitcoin on your desktop and to send money to or from it to your App keeping a minimal balance on the App at any time.
    A second option, is to use the Backup button to email the wallet to a safe location. At a latter time you can send the email back to a device on which this App is installed, open the email and tap on the wallet.dat attachment. Select Open in "BitCoin" and follow the instructions.
