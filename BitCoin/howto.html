            This is an experimental software; you can lose bitcoins as a result. By using this App you agree to its license. The App performs many intensive computations, especially when it starts, so please be patient when you see the "Please wait..." message. However, no computation or communication is performed when the App is sent to the background.

            This App allows you to use virtual currency in <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">BitCoin peer-to-peer network</a>.
            The network is made of nodes that have similar functionality. Your App is running a local node that connects to others in the network. You can check how many other nodes, your local node is connected to, in the Console/getinfo page. It takes some time for your local node to find its neighbors so be patient.
            </p>
            <p>
            In the Console/getinfo page you will also notice the amount of blocks already downloaded by the local node. Blocks contains information on all transactions ever made in the bitcoin network, so the amount is substantial (around <a href="http://blockexplorer.com/">120,000</a> at the time of writing this or 200MB of storage on your device.) The local node should download all past blocks before it can examine new blocks that may contain transactions of bitcoins directed to you. The first download can take several hours, but its done only once and you can stop and continue later. It is recommended to charge your device while this is taking place. There is some delay even after downloading all past blocks, as the network generates new blocks, at about every 10min.
            </p>
            <p>
            Your local node contains your own private <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet">wallet</a>. As with physical money, if anything happens to your wallet (stolen, hardware, software or accident), the entire amount stored in it (as given in the Balance page) will be forever lost, or used by others, so be careful. One option is to install and run bitcoin on your desktop and to send money to or from it to your App keeping a minimal balance on the App at any given time.
            A second option, is to use the Backup button to email the wallet to a safe location (anyone that can access the email will be able to spend its bitcoins.) At a latter time you can send the email back to a device on which this App is installed, open the email and tap on the wallet.dat attachment. Select "Open in BitCoin" and follow the instructions. It is recommended to repeat the backup whenever the address changes. You can also use the wallet restore process, just described, to replicate an existing bitcoin wallet you have on your desktop and email it to your device.
            A third option is to sync your device with iTunes and locate the wallet in the backup folder created by iTunes (follow <a href="http://petewarden.github.com/iPhoneTracker/#2">these instructions</a> but instead of doing <span style="color: blue">grep consolidated</span> do <span style="color: blue">grep Documents/wallet.dat</span> of course, an implication of this is that a copy of your wallet is located on your desktop, so be careful with it, or set iTunes to encrypt your backup.
            </p>
            <p>
            In transactions, bitcoins (and cents of) are carried from one <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address">address</a> to another. You can use any of the addresses given in the My Address page to receive bitcoins. By using different addresses you can secure your anonymity in the bitcoin network, you can even create more addresses by using the add button on the top right. You can copy-paste in the usual way.  For example, try getting a tiny amount from the <a href="http://freebitcoins.appspot.com/">Bitcoin Faucet</a> or you can buy coins in one of the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Category:Exchanges">exchanges</a>; another option is to <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Category:Mining">mine</a> for bitcoins on your desktop. In addition, you can ask for bitcoins from someone else running this App by emailing him. Tap on an address and select the email option, the email will include a link that will open the BitCoin App on the device on which the email is read (assuming the App is already installed there.)
            </p>
            <p>
            In order to send bitcoins you need enough amounts shown in the Balance page. When sending, enter the address to which you want to send and the amount. This page opens automatically, with the correct address, if you click on an email sent from this App running on another device.

            You can decide to connect to a remote node, running on a different machine instead of your local node. You can select one of the preconfigured commands including help which shows the commands made available by the remote node. You can also enter the command manually and use quotes and back-slash to enter command parameters. When running remotely, all information displayed by this App relates to the remote node, if the remote node runs a different version of bitcoin (see getinfo) then the behaviour and available commands may be different from your local node. The remote node needs to be configured to be an <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_(JSON-RPC)">HTTP-RPC-JSON</a> server and allow access to your client. You can switch back to using the local node, running on your App, but if its not needed you can stop it (and save battery) using Console/stop.
